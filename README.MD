## macOS Opencore Guide (Originally for Lenovo Ideapad S340) 
  
**THIS REPO IS A FORK OF [R-RARE'S REPO](https://github.com/R-Rare/Lenovo-Ideapad-S340-Hackintosh-Catalina-OpenCore)**

*I made this because R-Rare's repo is outdated and I will try to update the EFI folder ~~and guide~~ soon.*

*For now use the following guide: https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/update.html#updating-opencore*
