**THIS REPO IS FORK OF (R-RARE'S REPO)[https://github.com/R-Rare/Lenovo-Ideapad-S340-Hackintosh-Catalina-OpenCore]**
Hey, looks like you came across my repository for this device. Looking to install macOS on it? Let's get started!

  

  

Notes: My CPU (Intel Core i3-8145U) is Whiskey Lake - however for our case as it's an 8th Gen CPU, we will follow the Coffee Lake guidelines.

This is written for OpenCore 0.5.8, new OpenCore releases happen on the Monday of the next month.

  
*****_April 18, 2020 Update_*****
- Moved VoodooInput kext locations to correct position on Kernel -> Add
- Added CPUFriend and CPUFriendDataProvider. Link on how to create: (Is disabled in config) [https://github.com/corpnewt/CPUFriendFriend](https://github.com/corpnewt/CPUFriendFriend)
- Changed Kernel Quirks - You must disable CFG-Lock in BIOS if you want to keep the `AppleCpuPmCfgLock` off. This will also improve boot times. Source: [https://github.com/Hasodikis/Lenovo-Ideapad-s540-14IWL---Hackintosh](https://github.com/Hasodikis/Lenovo-Ideapad-s540-14IWL---Hackintosh) (Scroll down for tutorial)



*****_April 13, 2020 Update_*****

- Updated Guide

  

  

*****_April 12, 2020 Update_*****

Update History:

- macOS 10.14.4: *_Works, however feels less fluid than Catalina._*

- macOS 10.15.1: Successful - see notes for trackpad

- macOS 10.15.2: Successful - see notes for trackpad

- macOS 10.15.3: Successful - see notes for trackpad

- macOS 10.15.4: Successful - see notes for trackpad ****and HDMI****

- macOS 10.15.4 Supplemental Update: Successful - see notes for trackpad

  

---

  

Known Quirks

  

- FN + K will lower brightness.

- FN + P will increase brightness.

- Brightness adjustment isn't smooth.

- Trackpad can't be used to wake up from sleep.

- Power Button can't be used to wake up the machine until it is completely asleep. This won't be a problem, just use the keyboard to wake up the machine.

- Power button doesn't bring up the power menu.

- It has came to my attention HDMI has a yellow tint issue.

---

  

What does not work:  

- DRM - This won't work any iGPU, because Intel's graphics cards don't support FairPlay.

  

- Intel WiFi. This ****must**** be replaced in order to use WiFi.

  

- BCM94350ZAE Bluetooth - will look into.

  

  

---

  

What does work (Mostly everything you'd expect):

  

  



- Keyboard

  

- Trackpad, full gestures

  

- Camera

  

- Graphics Acceleration

  

- CPU Power Management


- SD Card



- Battery

  

- Display Brightness and Brightness Keys (F11 and F12)

  

- Intel Bluetooth

  

- USB Ports

  

- Keyboard Backlight and Fan Management (Controlled by the BIOS)

  

- Sleep and Wake

  

- Audio and Internal Combo Port

  

- iMessage and FaceTime (Assuming you setup your SMBIOS correctly)

  

- ~~that annoying power button LED that flickers when battery is low~~

  

  

So, let's set it up!

  

---

  

BIOS Settings

  

- Disk Mode: AHCI

  

- Intel Platform Trust Technology: Disabled

  

- Intel SGX Mode: Disabled

  

- Intel Virtualization: Optional, recommended to Disable

  

- Secure Boot: Disabled

- Disable CFG Lock
-

**Disable CFG Lock**
--

Fully power off the laptop. Enter the BIOS by pressing F2 at boot. Power off the laptop again. Quickly enter the following code:
```
     F1 → 1 → Q → A → Z
     
     F2 → 2 → W → S → X
     
     F3 → 3 → E → D → C
     
     F4 → 4 → R → F → V
     
     F5 → 5 → T → G → B
     
     F6 → 6 → Y → H → N
   ```

Power on the laptop while pressing F2 at boot. You'll see a lot of debug options. Don't mess with them. We only need to change one setting. 

**Advanced → Power & Performance → CPU-Power Management Control → CPU Lock Configuration → CFG Lock → Disabled**

Exit and Save, and CFG Lock will be disabled.


 # Start the process

First, here's the guide I followed.

  
[https://1revenger1.gitbook.io/laptop-guide/](https://1revenger1.gitbook.io/laptop-guide/)
In the near future, this guide will be deprecated, and instead use [https://dortania.github.io/vanilla-laptop-guide/](https://dortania.github.io/vanilla-laptop-guide/)
  

*__Create the USB and EFI Partition.__*

  

- Use the `createinstallmedia` command from Apple, or [gibMacOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS) to make the installer. Mount the EFI Partition.

  

- Add the OpenCore files to it. Make it look exactly like below (delete files!)

  

- - -

  

- EFI

  

- - BOOTx64.efi

  

- OC

  

- - ACPI

  

- - Drivers

  

- - - APFSDriveLoader.efi

  

- - - HFSPlus.efi (Don't use vBoxHFS, it's slow)

  

- - - OpenRuntime.efi (Previously called FWRuntimeServices.efi)

  

- - Kexts

  

- - Tools

  

- - - OpenShell.efi (Optional - Usefull for accessing the EFI shell)

  

- - -

  

  

Great! Now that your directory tree looks like this, we need kexts. You can find these in the guide linked above.

  

Add these to OC/Kexts

  

- VirtualSMC.kext

  

- - SMCProcessor.kext

  

- - SMCBatteryManager.kext

  

- - SMCSuperIO.kext

  

- Lilu.kext

  

- WhateverGreen.kext

  

- AppleALC.kext

  

- VoodooPS2Controller.kext

  

- VoodooI2C.kext

  

- - VoodooI2CHID.kext

  

- NoTouchID.kext

  

  

If you have working WiFi (a compatible WiFi Card that ******isn't****** a real Apple card, or Fenvi) add these:

  

- AirportBrcmFixup.kext

  

- BrcmBluetoothInjector.kext

  

- BrcmFirmwareData.kext

  

- BrcmPatchRAM3.kext

  

  

They may be different for you card, so check here!

  

  

[https://khronokernel-7.gitbook.io/wireless-buyers-guide/types-of-wireless-card/m2](https://khronokernel-7.gitbook.io/wireless-buyers-guide/types-of-wireless-card/m2)

  

  

---

  

Got your Kexts? Great, we need to add ACPI Patches to add functionality to the laptop.

  

  

  

The ACPI Guide is covered here:

  

  

[https://khronokernel.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/](https://khronokernel.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/)

  

  

  

- SSDT-GPI0 - Adds a hook for VoodooI2C controller (Required for trackpad support)

  

- SSDT-XOSI - Redirects _OSI to XOSI calls (Required for trackpad support)

  

- SSDT-PNLFCFL - SSDT-PNLF doesn't work on Whiskey Lake, SSDT-PNLFCFL is specifically for this and some Coffee lake laptops, it will enable the backlight and brightness adjustment. (But it won't make the brightness keys work!)

  

- SSDT-Q11Q12 - Redirects ACPI calls from the keyboard to macOS, to enable using F11 and F12 to adjust the brightness. Also requires two ACPI patches.

  

- SSDT-PLUG - plugin-type=1 for OpenCore, enables native CPU Power management. Note you have too look into your DSDT and change some values.
  

- SSDT-GPRW - Lets the laptop sleep and wake up! No more insomnia in macOS.

  

  

  

- SSDT-PSF13 - Changes the PrintScreen button from disable trackpad to F13 (Optional)

  

# OpenCore config.plist

  

  

Grab the sample.plist file from the Docs folder and paste it to `OC` Folder. Rename it to `config.plist`

  

  

  

Example:

  

  

`EFI/OC/config.plist`

  

  

  

Use [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) to edit the plist.

  

  

  

Go to File -> OC Clean Snapshot. Point it at the OC folder.

  

  

  

Note: To OC Snapshot: `CTRL + R` or `Command + R` and point it at the OC folder. It will automatically add your kexts, drivers, and ACPI patches to the config.

  

  

  

For CoffeeLake, the entire config.plist is covered here:

  

  

[https://khronokernel.github.io/Opencore-Vanilla-Desktop-Guide/config.plist/coffee-lake.html](https://khronokernel.github.io/Opencore-Vanilla-Desktop-Guide/config.plist/coffee-lake.html)

  

  

  

A few changes need to be made for this device.

  

  

ACPI -> Patch

  

  

Dump your DSDT to check your EC device - it should be named `EC0`. If it ain't look here on how to rename different ones. ******Make sure you dump your DSDT in Windows or Linux.******

  

  

Use [SSDTTime](https://github.com/corpnewt/SSDTTime) to dump it.

[https://khronokernel.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/Laptops/laptop-ec.html](https://khronokernel.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/Laptops/laptop-ec.html)

  

  

  

******Rename EC0 to EC******

  

---

  

  

`Comment` = `Change EC0 to EC` [String]

  

  

`Count` = `0` [Number]

  

  

`Enabled` = `True` [Bool]

  

  

`Find` = `4543305F` [Data]

  

  

`Limit` = 0 [Number]

  

  

`Replace` = `45435F5F` [Data]

  

  

  

******Change _OSI to XOSI******

  

---

  

  

`Comment` = `Change _OSI to XOSI` [String]

  

  

`Count` = `0` [Number]

  

  

`Enabled` = `True` [Bool]

  

  

`Find` = `5F4F5349` [Data]

  

  

`Limit` = 0 [Number]

  

  

`Replace` = `584F5349` [Data]

  

  

  

******Change Method(_Q11,0,N) to XQ11******

  

---

  

  

`Comment` = `Change Method(_Q11,0,N) to XQ11` [String]

  

  

`Count` = `0` [Number]

  

  

`Enabled` = `True` [Bool]

  

  

`Find` = `5F513131 00` [Data]

  

  

`Limit` = 0 [Number]

  

  

`Replace` = `58513131 00` [Data]

  

  

  

******Change Method(_Q12,0,N) to XQ12******

  

---

  

  

`Comment` = `Change Method(_Q12,0,N) to XQ12` [String]

  

  

`Count` = `0` [Number]

  

  

`Enabled` = `True` [Bool]

  

  

`Find` = `5F513132 00` [Data]

  

  

`Limit` = 0 [Number]

  

  

`Replace` = `58513132 00` [Data]

  

  

  

---


  

  

That's all for ACPI.

Under Booter -> Quirks

  

  

`DevirtualizeMmio` ******must****** be set to FALSE

  

  

`RebuildAppleMemoryMap` ******must****** be set to FALSE

  

  

`SetupVirtualMap` ******must****** be set to TRUE

  

  

  

Under DeviceProperties -> PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)

  

For a UHD 620 / UHD 630 on WhiskeyLake:

  

`AAPL,ig-platform-id` = `0900A53E` [Data]

`device-id` = `A53E0000` [Data]

  

If you have a dedicated / discrete GPU, it is ******not****** compatible, so make sure to disable it! Use an SSDT to fully disable it, or use the boot-argument `-wegnoegpu` to hide it from macOS. You can also check the DeviceProperties equivalent in the WhateverGreen Faq.

  

To properly add the AppleALC layout-id, we'll use DeviceProperties ******instead of the boot-argument. If you have****  `alcid=XX`  ***_**_remove it._**_*****

  

  

My working alcid is 11, it goes as follows:

  

  

DeviceProperties -> PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1F,0x3)

  

  

`layout-id` = `0B00000` [Data]

  

  

In depth here:

  

  

[https://khronokernel-2.gitbook.io/opencore-vanilla-desktop-guide/post-install/post-install/audio](https://khronokernel-2.gitbook.io/opencore-vanilla-desktop-guide/post-install/post-install/audio)

  

  

  

If you have a Broadcom BCM94350ZAE WiFi Card (DW1820a) you might be able to get it to work correctly. (mine does)

  

  

Under DeviceProperties -> PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1D,0x2)/Pci(0x0,0x0)

  

  

`pci-aspm-default` = `0` [Number]

  

  

This will disable power management for the card, and (in my case) it worked.

  

  

  

  

# Fixing Apple iCloud, FaceTime, Messages, and other Apple Services.

  

  

Use [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) to generate a SMBIOS, under PlatformInfo -> Generic. Use `MacBookPro14,1` if you plan to use HDMI. In details here: [https://khronokernel-2.gitbook.io/opencore-vanilla-desktop-guide/post-install/post-install/iservices](https://khronokernel-2.gitbook.io/opencore-vanilla-desktop-guide/post-install/post-install/iservices)

  

  

Make sure you do this correctly! If you get an Apple Support Customer Code, you have to call Apple to get it fixed. Also, ******you will need an Ethernet/WiFi device named en0 and is built-in.******

  

  

# Fixing Audio, again!

  

You may notice if you have headphones / mic plugged into the Combo port, that waking from sleep completely breaks it.

  

  

Run `./install.sh` Inside the HDAFix Folder. Gatekeeper will deny it so you must go to Settings -> Security to allow ALCPlugFix and hdafix to run. AppleALC will take care of the rest.

  

Reboot.

  

  

  

# Enabling GUI and Boot Chime

  

  

This is fairly easy, covered here:

  

  

[https://khronokernel-2.gitbook.io/opencore-vanilla-desktop-guide/extras/gui](https://khronokernel-2.gitbook.io/opencore-vanilla-desktop-guide/extras/gui)

  

  

  

Copy the resources folder from [here](https://github.com/acidanthera/OcBinaryData) into `EFI/OC`

  

Example: `EFI/OC/Resources/`

  

  

Grab OpenCanopy.efi from here. https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases

  

It's in the OC/Drivers folder. You may of deleted it earlier when setting up your EFI Folder.

  

  

Add `OpenCanopy.efi` to `EFI/OC/Drivers`

  

  

Example: `EFI/OC/Drivers/OpenCanopy.efi`

  

  

  

******Do not forget to run OC Snapshot (CTRL / Command + R) to add it to your config.plist******

  

  

In the config change the picker mode:

  

  

- Misc -> Boot -> `PickerMode` = `External` [String]

  

  

  

Setup BootChime:

  

  

Note: AudioDXE will delay your OpenCore load time slightly.

  

  

Follow the guide linked above. Use these values, if they don't work, they may not be the same.

  

  

`AudioCodec`= `0` [Number]

  

  

`AudioDevice` = `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1F,0x3)` [String]

  

  

`AudioOut`= `0` [Number]

  

  

# HDMI Tutorial

  

  

![HDMI Working on Core i3-8145U Model](https://i.imgur.com/eHeHHCK.jpg)

  

- Notes:

- - HDMI hot-plug may take multiple attempts before initiating in rapid secession.

- - 10.15.4 makes the port a lot less reliable, ****avoid the update**** by using the `ChangeUpdates.txt` file in the tools folder to completely ignore the update. With this update, the HDMI port won't initialize on boot or when waking up the computer.

- - Be ready to change your SMBIOS data.

  

****Setting up the config.plist****

  

- Use GenSMBIOS to generate a SMBIOS for `MacBookPro14,1`

- *_Change GPU to Iris 655 to match SMBIOS:_*

- - Set `device-id` to `0x3EA50009`, `0900A53E` Hexswapped for DeviceProperties

- - Set `AAPL,ig-platform-id` to `0x3EA58086`, `3EA50009` Hexswapped for DeviceProperties

- Use Hackintool to generate a framebuffer patch using these settings:

  

- Pre-Notes: You mileage may vary

- - LVDS is for the eDP Internal Display.

- - As you can see, my HDMI port is Index 2 (Port 0x06) and requires Bus ID 0x02 to function. Setting the Pipe to 18 can sometimes help hot-plug issues. However, it's not perfect and may require multiple attempts.

  

![Hackintool Connectors](https://i.imgur.com/VKSf5FD.png)

  

  

Full guide: https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-general-framebuffer-patching-guide-hdmi-black-screen-problem.269149/

  

  

****Tip:**** To find your HDMI Index - Set each connector to -1 one at a time,

when you plug in your HDMI port it will kernel panic.

  

For example, my HDMI Port Index is 2, when set to -1 it will kernel panic.

  

That's how you can identify your port, instead of guessing.

  
# SD Card

O2 Readers will need to be renamed (see tonymac post)

Realtek cards have support now

Use cholonam's fork of Sinteks driver

https://github.com/cholonam/Sinetek-rtsx/releases

  

# USB Mapping

  

After you setup your HDMI port, your USB ports should also be setup correctly. In my case - USB 3.0 worked, however USB 2.0 hot-plug was completely messed up. No worries, fixing USB is really easy.

  

  

Summary: Plug in a USB 2.0 device to every USB port, set the ports that light up green as USB 2, plug a USB 3.0 device, set the types as USB 3.0.

  

Remove Unused Connectors by highlighting and pressing the Remove button.

  

Add the USBPorts.kext to EFI/OC/Kexts/ and use OC Snapshot in ProperTree.

  

The guide isn't perfect, but it will give you a general idea on what to do.

# Additional Notes and Troubleshooting

  

  

******The trackpad isn't working******

  

  

I'm not all sure about this one, as mine just, *__works__*, but you can check here to make sure everything is correct. Note that my exact model has an I2CHID Trackpad, your's could be different.

  

  

[https://1revenger1.gitbook.io/laptop-guide/prepare-install-macos/setting-up-input-devices](https://1revenger1.gitbook.io/laptop-guide/prepare-install-macos/setting-up-input-devices)

  

****IF YOU UPDATED AND IT ISN'T WORKING*****

  

If it *__was__* working and stopped after an update, running `sudo kextcache -i /` and rebooting will fix it.

  

  

  

******My WiFi doesn't work! What are other options?******

  

  

~~Just buy a working WiFi card, simple.~~

  

  

This laptop has no Ethernet Port, but you aren't SOL.

  

  

- If you have an iPhone, you might be able to use TetherMe, but I don't know much about it, so don't ask me.

  

  

- If you have an Android Phone, you can use HoRNDIS.

  

  

Inject it through OpenCore instead of using the installer, as the installer installs the kext to Library/Extensions.

  

  

Copy HoRNDIS.kext from Tools/HoRNDIS.kext to EFI/OC/Kext/HoRNDIS.kext. OC Snapshot with Propertree.

  

  

Also, I would be *__highly against__* using USB WiFi in macOS, I would *__highly__* recommend using a proper WiFi card for this.

  

  

******macOS doesn't see my disk******

  

  

Make sure that your storage settings is set to AHCI instead of RAID.

  

  

*****_macOS 10.15.4 makes the HDMI port a whole lot less reliable, read through the HDMI tutorial for more information._*****
